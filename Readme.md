## Complexity
* delete: Linear — O(n), or O(log n) in average case
* insert: Linear — O(n), or O(log n) in average case
* contains: Linear — O(n), or O(log n) in average case
* depthFirstLog: Linear — O(n), or O(log n) in average case

### Install
`npm install`

### Test
`npm run test`

### Start
`npm start`


## TODO

### games
* Design an algorithm to find a path from one node in a binary tree to another.

* Given a binary tree, check whether it’s a binary search tree or not.

* Find the minimum depth of binary search tree

* Given a binary search tree and a value k, please find a node in the binary search tree whose value is closest to k.
